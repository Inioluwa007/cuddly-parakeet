  <h1 style="text-align:center ;">Why People Love Manchester United? </h1>
  <p>Manchester United is often acknowledged as one of, if not the biggest club in football.

    Its fanbase spreads across the breadth of the globe, the brand as instantly recognisable as it is synonymous with
    success.

    But why is this? Why do so many fans across the world fall in love with the Red Devils?
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some of the reasons why people love Manchester United :
  <ol>
    <li><h1>Dramatic Comebacks</h1>JUVENTUS 2 MANCHESTER UNITED 3, 1999 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL
      This Champions League semi-final win was arguably a greater comeback than the final itself.
      Juventus had appeared in the previous three finals and comprehensively outplayed Man United in t
      he first leg, as Fergie's team scrambled a last minute equaliser to grab a draw.
      With 11 minutes gone in Turin, Juventus were 2-0 up and cruising, but United kept going and a
      goal from Roy Keane after 24 minutes turned the tie on its head.
      By half-time United were level and after 84 minutes Andy Cole grabbed a deserved winner.
      Against all the odds, Manchester United were through to the final… </li>

    <li><h1>Big-Money Signings</h1>Despite the fact that Manchester City and Chelsea have recently
      overtaken United as the most spendthrift teams in the Premier League,
      the Red Devils are certainly not afraid to splash the cash.
      This past summer, over £40 million was spent on transfers,
      £24 million of which on the marquee signing of world-class striker Robin van Persie from rivals Arsenal.
      Despite the dodgy financial position of the club's owners, the Glazer family,
      funds for spending are always made available every season.
      There's good reason United are linked with just about every player under the sun in the transfer gossip columns.

    <li><h1>Sir Alex Ferguson</h1>For many United fans, the prospect of life without manager Sir Alex Ferguson is unthinkable.
      Indeed, many, myself included, weren't even born when the Scotsman was first appointed at the club.
      His legacy is undeniable, his success unbelievable.
      Whilst at United, he has won 12 Premier League trophies, the FA Cup five times and the Champions League twice.
      Simply put, he is surely the greatest manager to have lived.</li>
